                problem: `"How might we help Brazilian social media influencers monetize content with faster payouts and stronger audience engagement?"

Privi was founded with the mission of facilitating social media influencers into monetising their work effectively and hassle-free. The team had already done some market-opportunity mappings through initial interviews, and identified a viable entry-point with financial management of subscriptions and fast money-retrieval alternatives (in comparison to generic players on the market such as OnlyFans). Our goal was to find a way to viable penetration of the brazilian market specifically - focusing initially on the sensual content audience.`,
                process: `The product focused initially on the audience's biggest pain point: the means for the collection of subscriptions money and sharing of content through e-mails and private links. We were able to collect some clients with active engagement based on the initial model, and better understand the needs of the industry so we could aim at scalable growth. We ran multiple rounds of small iterations and sales interviews with the target audience to understand the general market, customer needs and where the product needed to go in order to find product market fit.

Our research approach included:
- Sales and discovery interviews with influencers to explore needs and market entry.
- Persona mapping (creators and subscribers) to better define user journeys.
- Surveys with content creator subscribers to understand content discovery and usability issues.
- Two rounds of moderated usability tests (5 sessions each) with pilot customers to validate navigation, clarity, and desirability of the new flows.`,
                solutions: `From research, we identified four core needs that shaped the product strategy:

1. Seamless financial management
Creators needed faster confirmation of subscriptions, transparent earnings, and instant withdrawals. This became a key differentiator of Privi.

2. Expansion into adjacent markets
While sensual content was the initial entry point, we discovered similar needs in fitness, nutrition, and lifestyle creators. This insight drove a rebranding effort to broaden appeal.

3. From selling to sharing
Creators wanted more than payment links—they needed a social space to share, interact, and receive feedback. This led us to expand into community and profiling features.

4. Subscriber experience
For audiences, the platform had to be more than just a payment gateway. Content discovery and influencer exploration were added to make Privi a place where fans could find and follow new creators.

After testing initial design alternatives, we refined the product through two iterative rounds of usability testing with pilot customers. These sessions ensured the experience was understandable, easy to navigate, and engaging before scaling to a wider audience.`,
